# HSBC UK Loan Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project presents a detailed analysis of loan data from HSBC UK. In a highly competitive banking environment, a detailed understanding of loan applicant profiles is essential. This analysis aims to identify key trends and support strategic decision-making. The analysis is based on a dataset comprising 45,000 records and 14 variables, covering applicant profiles, loan characteristics, and credit history.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are:

* Evaluate the risk associated with HSBC UK's loan portfolio to identify default trends.
* Understand borrower characteristics and their impact on loan performance.
* Optimise lending strategies by identifying profitable customer segments.
* Develop data-driven insights to improve credit risk management.
* Visualise key trends and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using Power BI to support strategic decision-making.

## Tools Used

* **Python**: Used for initial data exploration and data quality validationte.
* **SQL Server**: Used for preparing and analysing data using SQL scripts.
* **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualising key metrics.

## Methodology

The analysis followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Extraction & Cleaning**: Queried the loan dataset and performed data cleaning, handled missing values, and removed duplicates.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analysed loan distribution, borrower profiles, loan performance, and identified correlations between key variables.
3.  **Advanced Analytics**: Analysed borrower solvency, behavioural trends, time trends, and identified high-risk segments.
4.  **KPI Development & Dashboarding**: Developed visual reports highlighting key insights and presented findings with actionable recommendations.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Tracked

* Loan Approval Rate.
* Average Loan Amount.
* Interest Rate Distribution.
* Credit Score Distribution.
* Profitability Index.

## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations

The analysis yielded several strategic recommendations to optimise lending strategies and manage risk:

* **Optimising Loan Allocation Criteria**:
    * Prioritise borrowers with greater professional stability, potentially offering preferential rates. Develop solutions for younger professionals integrating other stability criteria.
    * Reassess risk criteria for homeowners, potentially tailoring offers or developing refinancing options.
    * Implement a nuanced scoring model for borrowers with a default history, potentially offering "second chance" programs with strict monitoring or mandatory insurance.
    * Refine credit score analysis to identify critical thresholds and offer credit improvement solutions.
* **Optimisation of Loan Management**:
    * Adapt repayment terms based on the borrowed amount and risk profile, potentially developing competitive small loans or flexible options for large loans.
    * Prioritise loans for less risky purposes (e.g., debt consolidation, medical expenses) and strengthen criteria for riskier uses (e.g., personal investments).

## Visualisation

Interactive dashboards were created using Power BI to visualise:

* **Loan Portfolio Summary**: Statistics on loan disbursement, approvals, and rejections.
* **Loan Portfolio Overview**: Approval rates by segment, credit score impact, interest revenue, loan distribution by sector, and high-value customer insights.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides actionable insights for HSBC UK to enhance profitability and minimise risk by optimising lending strategies. Next steps involve implementing the recommendations and monitoring KPIs to evaluate their impact.
